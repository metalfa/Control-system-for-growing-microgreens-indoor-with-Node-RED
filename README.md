# ABSTRACT 
  The objective of this project is to design an automatic control system for growing indoor microgreens. The concept of smart farming and machine learning were used and applied. Node-RED and Blynk were used as main tools to develop the Internet of Things (IoT) system. The cabinet is 40 cm wide, 60 cm long and 60 cm height with temperature, moisture, and light controlled according to each type of plants. The feedback from users were used as data to feed back to the system to develop control conditions for the plant. When comparing the plants those were grown inside and outside the controlled cabinet, the results showed that the plants grown in the system were growing more consistent than the plants grown outside the system. In addition, the controlled cabinet can also programmed to control some specific variables under certain conditions.
